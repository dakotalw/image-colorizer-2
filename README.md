## Overview

**Problem:** 


## Data

- Dataset of sports photos (408.5 MB)
- Includes photos of over 100 sports, with 10,000+ entries
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/sports-classification


## Methodology

### Convolutional Neural Network
- Built a model that 1) decomposes a color picture and recolorizes it and 2) colorizes black and white photos
- Improved upon a pretrained model (ex: switched loss function from MSE to LPIPS)
- 18 layers that reduce and convolute the photo, and then deconvolutes it back to a full size image
